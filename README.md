# Vivint for Home Assistant

Home Assistant integration for a Vivint home security system.

<!-- BEGIN AUTO-GENERATED INSTALLATION -->

## ⬇️ Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=natekspencer&repository=ha-vivint&category=integration)

This integration is available in the default [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) repository.

1. Use the **My Home Assistant** badge above, or from within Home Assistant, click on **HACS**
2. Search for `Vivint` and click on the appropriate repository
3. Click **DOWNLOAD**
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `custom_components/vivint` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory. If this is your first custom component, you may need to create the directory.
   Example paths:
   - Hassio: `/config/custom_components`
   - Hassbian: `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/custom_components`
3. Restart Home Assistant

> ⚠️ Manual installation will not provide automatic update notifications. HACS installation is recommended unless you have a specific need.

## ➕ Setup

Once installed, you can set up the integration by clicking on the following badge:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=vivint)

Alternatively:

1. Go to [Settings > Devices & services](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/)
2. In the bottom-right corner, select **Add integration**
3. Type `Vivint` and select the **Vivint** integration
4. Follow the instructions to add the integration to your Home Assistant
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED INSTALLATION -->

## ⚙️ Options

After this integration is set up, you can configure a couple of options relating to the camera streams:

- **HD Stream** - indicates whether to stream the camera in high definition or not, defaults to `True`
- **RTSP Stream** - which RTSP stream source to use, defaults to `Direct`. Can be one of:
  - _Direct_ - falls back to the internal RTSP stream if direct access is unavailable
  - _Internal_ - use this if, for some reason, you have a camera that doesn't seem to stream despite the Vivint API indicating direct access is available for it
  - _External_ - use this option if your Vivint system and Home Assistant installation are on separate networks without access to each other
